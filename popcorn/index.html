                        Hi, my name is Xaven.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Would you like to support Cub Scouts by ordering some popcorn?

                    <p>
                        I am really excited to finally join Cub Scouts this year as a Tiger Cub.  I already attended summer day camp this year and I had lots of fun shooting BB guns and archery, but also making LOTS of great crafts, playing games, and singing songs.  I can't wait to earn my Bobcat and Tiger badges this fall!

                        <a href="http://www.trails-end.com/shop/scouts/email_referral.jsp?id=28202908">Visit the Trails End Popcorn website</a>
                        to see the different kinds of popcorn available and to place your order online.  You'll see "Supporting Scout Xaven H."
                        in the upper-right corner--that's how you know your order will get credited to me.
